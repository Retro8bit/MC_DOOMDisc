# MC_DOOMDisc
A Minecraft Java Edition resource pack that replaces the default songs on the music discs found in-game with a selection of music from the DOOM franchise.
I did not make any of the music in this pack, all rights to the songs used go to the respective artists and copyright holders. 
I encourage you to go out and buy the songs featured in this pack becouse they all rock.
